# BeatFinger-Hololens

A Table Top Beatsaber-like game made on Microsoft Hololens 2  

Future Roadmap:  
- [ ] iPad spectator mode to share the experience  
- [ ] "Warm Welcome" game opening animation 
- [ ] Cube destruction debris
- [ ] Cube shaders to make things looks better
- [ ] Support for Custom Beatsaber song maps
- [ ] Scene interactions from iPad spectator mode (so viewers can interact with the game as well)
- [ ] Unity MARS for game placement
